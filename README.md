# SSWSysAdmins.SyncNPS
The script is used to sync NPS (radius), this is what allows us to connect to our wifi using our SSW credentials, between our two Sydney DCs. That way we have some redundancy with this if one of the servers is offline.

Sync NPS config between DCs

This needs to run on the master NPS server as a scheduled task

Replace masterIP with the IP of the secondary NPS server
